Hi, I'm Andy and I am a junior software engineer who has recently graduated from the _nology tech consultancy programme.

After graduating from Lancaster University with a BSc in Physics and an Msc in Energy and the Environment I knew that my creative and technical skills in problem solving were suited perfectly for a career in technology, and I am particularly passionate about about how it has affected my area of interests to improve knowledge and efficiency. Following a career in skydiving and I am now retraining in this field.

In my spare time I still skydive for fun and I am a keen vipassana meditator and lover of the outdoors.
